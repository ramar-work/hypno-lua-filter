- you might not be able to finish all this... but ca

1. Test out that zdb_to_ztable is working.
	(B/c of SQL)
2. Read everything in HTTP (should be easy)
	(This should not take long, save to http table and make it global)
3. Get SSL rework working
4. Lua lib interface stuff... it's an easy language, but lacks a lot of nice facilities
	(Basic error handling)
	(Tables and other values)
5. Finallly, you can probably start work on packages...

This can't take more than 2 days (so Saturday or something)
