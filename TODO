- Always a fuckin' todo file...



x extract the host from the thing (no port number)

#if 0
	- try fixing up the Lua backend
		(easy to do all the other stuff)
#else
	- check the host against the routes structure
	- call the right route (how do you call the home route?)
#endif

	? can I turn a table to HTML?
		get some basic queries working

	? get static stuff working
